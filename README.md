# Maze Solver Program

## Description
This C++ program aims to solve mazes using a recursive approach. Given a textual representation of a maze with designated start and destination points, the program navigates through the maze, marking the path it takes. If a solution exists, the program displays the path through the maze.

## Features
- **Maze Solving:** Employs a recursive algorithm to find a path from the start point to the destination.
- **Custom Maze Input:** Reads maze configurations from a text file, allowing for diverse maze designs.
- **Path Visualization:** Marks the path taken through the maze, showing successful routes and dead ends.
- **File-Based Configuration:** Users can create and use their own maze configurations in text files.

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program:** Use a C++ compiler to compile the source code. Example with GCC: `g++ -o MazeSolver main.cpp`.
2. **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled program. You will be prompted to enter the name of a file containing the maze.
3. **Interact with the Program:** Press ENTER to start the maze-solving process and view the solution if one exists.

## Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine. Make sure you have a C++ compiler to compile the program.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-solver.git
cd maze-solver
g++ -o MazeSolver main.cpp
./MazeSolver
```
